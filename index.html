		<h2> My Hobbies </h2>
		<p> Growing up, I played a lot of games mostly on PC. My favorite genre of games are massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) 
		and Multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Some games I play includes Maplestory, League Of Legends, Overwatch, Genshin Impact, Pokemon
		and Valorant. One game that I started to get into is called Eternal Return: Black Survival. It is a game that is still in its early stages,
		but I was able to play the early access on Steam.
